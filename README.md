<h1>
  🐣 Hi! I am a physics student that found passion in IT and cybersecurity! I upload here mostly writeups for CTFs but I am also trying to write some scripts. </br> </br>
</h1>
</div>

### 👨‍🏫 More about me:


- 📓 In February I plan to start to work on my blog (which i started writing in django some time ago) and on another, more complicated website. In the meantime, I work with my friends on the script that will solve numerically GR equations (more on that in <a href = "https://github.com/KsymenaPoradzisz/General_Relativity">General_Relativity repository </a>) and writeups for some boxes on tryhackme. 
- 💻 I enjoy programming because it gives me creative freedom. My interest about code grows exponentially when it doesn't work :) because I love to solve problems. I enjoy hacking because it gives me the feeling of power. During solving tryhackme boxes I learn a lot about networking which turns out to be really fun!
- ⚛️ My passion is still physics. I am more interested in very small things (atoms and particles) rather than very big things (astrophysics) but I love to listen about both of them.
