<h1>
  🐣 Hi! I am a physics student that found passion in IT and cybersecurity! I upload here mostly writeups for CTFs but I am also trying to write some scripts. </br> </br>

### 👨‍🏫 More about me:


In February I plan to start to work on my blog (which i started writing in django some time ago) and on another, more complicated website. In the meantime, I work with my friends on the script that will solve numerically GR equations (more on that in General_Relativity repository) and writeups for some boxes on tryhackme.
